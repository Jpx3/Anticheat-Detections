# NCP
I can't find the newest sources of NCP / any support discords.
## Anticheat Notes
- It's NCP. Enough said.

## How to detect
- NCP will always lag you back onto your last ground position unless the server has something else to drag you down. 
- The easiest way to check if a server runs NCP is by using vanilla fly and flying away from the ground and seeing if it teleports you back to the ground.
